# Text Summarization using BiLSTM, Encoder-Decoder Architecture, and BERT Transformer

## ✨ Project Overview

Customer reviews, especially on e-commerce platforms, can be lengthy and time-consuming to analyze manually. This project focuses on **abstractive text summarization** of customer reviews, aiming to generate concise summaries of long review texts automatically.

We leverage two approaches:
- **Custom BiLSTM Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Built using TensorFlow/Keras for generating summaries.
- **Pre-trained BERT Transformer (BART)**: Utilized through Hugging Face’s Transformers library for comparison and enhanced performance.

The project uses the **Amazon Fine Food Reviews** dataset sourced from **Kaggle**.

## 📚 Problem Statement

- Understand the concept of text summarization.
- Perform thorough data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Implement abstractive summarization using deep learning architectures.
- Compare custom models against state-of-the-art transformers.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for data manipulation and visualization)

## 🔗 Dataset

We have used the **[Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)** dataset available on Kaggle.  
This dataset contains 500,000+ food reviews including text, ratings, and summary fields.

## 🏗️ Project Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**:  
   Downloaded using Kaggle API.

2. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Removed duplicates and NaN values.
   - Converted all text to lowercase.
   - Removed HTML tags, special characters, numbers, and text within parentheses.
   - Added special tokens (`sostok`, `eostok`) to summaries.

3. **Text Preprocessing**:  
   - Tokenization.
   - Sequence padding.
   - Train-validation split.

4. **Model Building**:
   - **BiLSTM Encoder**: Processes input review text.
   - **Decoder with LSTM**: Predicts the summary sequence.
   - **Embedding Layer**: Learned word representations.
   - **Early Stopping**: To avoid overfitting.

5. **Training**:
   - Trained the BiLSTM model for 20 epochs with validation monitoring.

6. **Inference**:
   - Built separate encoder and decoder models for generating summaries.

7. **Transformer Summarization**:
   - Used **BART (facebook/bart-large-cnn)** from Hugging Face for benchmark summarization.

## 📈 Sample Results

- **Input**: "I recently purchased this organic green tea, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed..."
- **Generated Summary (BiLSTM Model)**: `great tea`
- **Generated Summary (BART Model)**: "I drink this tea every morning, and it gives me a calming start to my day..."
